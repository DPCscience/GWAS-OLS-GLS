###  GWAS-OLS-GLS

*Contact*: Gustavo de los Campos (gdeloscampos@gmail.com)

The following funcitons can be used to carry out GWAS using OLS and GLS for correlated errors. 
The objective is to illustrate how some of the required computations can be perofrmed and to demonstrate a few ways of improving
computational speed.


### 1 Sequential OLS GWAS using lm()


### 2 Sequential OLS GWAS using simple matrix operations

The function ```lm()``` carries a lot of comput
